### Task 000 - Prepare php page

Crate page called `task001.php` for your forst task. File should start with opening tag: `<?php`. PHP file should NOT include closing tag `?>`.

Reason why we left out closing tag is it can cause a lot of problems later. If you want to learn more read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4410704/why-would-one-omit-the-close-tag#4499749)

### task 001 - Echo language construct

In the file from previous task print out text using the language constuct `echo` and single quotes `'`;

I went down to the river,  
I set down on the bank.  
I tried to think but couldn't,  
So I jumped in and sank.  

I came up once and hollered!  
I came up twice and cried!  
If that water hadn't a-been so cold  
I might've sunk and died.

### Variables

Create variable with name `firstName` and initialize it with your name. Next, create a variable `$age` and initialize with your ages. Create one more variable with name `height` and assign your height as double (Example `1.78` in meters).

Use `print_r` and `var_dump` to see variable values and type.

You can notice that all variables are `strings`. You should convers `age` into `integer` and `height` into `double`.

After conversion asign a values to new variables `ageInteger` and `heightDouble`. Use `var_dump` or `print_r` to see how new varibles looks like.
